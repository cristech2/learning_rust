## Learning Rust Course

This repository is dedicated to practicing and learning the Rust programming language through a structured course presented in the Rust Book. The course covers fundamental concepts, syntax, and advanced topics in Rust, providing hands-on exercises and examples to reinforce learning.

### Course Structure

The course is organized into several modules, each focusing on different aspects of Rust programming:
1. **Introduction to Rust**: Overview of Rust, its features, and installation.
2. **Common Programming Concepts**: Variables, data types, functions, and control flow.
3. **Ownership and Borrowing**: Understanding Rust's unique ownership model.
4. **Structs**: Defining and using custom data types.
5. **Enums and Pattern Matching**: Working with enums and pattern matching techniques.
6. **Administrative Tasks**: Managing projects with Cargo, Rust's package manager.
7. **Common collections**: Using vectors, hash maps, and other collection types.
8. **Error Handling**: Handling errors using Result and Option types.
9. **Generic types, Traits, and Lifetimes**: Advanced type system features in Rust.
10. **Testing**: Writing and running tests in Rust.
11. **I/O Projects**: Building input/output CLI applications.
12. **Functional Language Features**: Exploring functional programming concepts in Rust. ITerators and closures.
13. **More about Cargo and Crates.io**: Managing dependencies and publishing crates.
14. **Smart Pointers**: Understanding smart pointers like Box, Rc, and RefCell.
15. **Unfear Concurrent Programming**: Writing safe concurrent code in Rust.
16. **Async Programming fundamentals**: Introduction to asynchronous programming in Rust.
17. **Rust as an object-oriented language**: Exploring OOP concepts in Rust.
18. **Patterns and Matching**: Advanced pattern matching techniques.
19. **Advanced Features**: Macros, unsafe Rust, and FFI (Foreign Function Interface).
20. **Final Project**: Building a complete application using the concepts learned throughout the course.
